# Java Style Guide

Java style guide built upon Sun Microsystems and Google style guides, widely accepted best practices. Is offered in
form of a textual representation, as well as `Checkstyle` and `Intellij IDEA` declarations for automation purposes.

[Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/) allows you to conduct static analysis of your Java code and
highlights its issues in the means of following the specified code style.
But it requires you to specify what is right and what is wrong. There is an official Sun Microsystems style guide,
but it's heavily outdated. There are plenty of other style guides but some of them go too far with allowing some
things, which can be considered a bad practice, and some are too strict.

If you struggle to choose a preferred style guide, this particular one is built upon _Sun Microsystems_ and _Google_ style
guides and is constantly updated to conform to the latest versions of Checkstyle.
You can freely use this one, or create a new one - just fork this repository and modify the style guide as it
better suited to your needs.
